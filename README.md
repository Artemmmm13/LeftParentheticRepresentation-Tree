# Left Parenthtic Representation of Tree #

The "Left Parenthetic Representation Tree" repository contains an implementation of a binary tree data structure using the left-parenthetic representation method. The left-parenthetic representation is a way of representing a binary tree as a string of characters, where each node is enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. The implementation includes methods for constructing a tree from a left-parenthetic string, as well as traversing the tree using various algorithms such as inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal. This implementation can be used as a reference or a starting point for further development in the field of binary trees and data structures.
